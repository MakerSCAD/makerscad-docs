.. _basicscene:

The basic scene
=============================

In order to start creating a 3D world we first need to set up a scene, in MakerSCAD we have preloaded a basic scene that comes with some basic lightning, material and shadow presets.
The basic scene can be found in the block library under the CAD/Tools section.

It looks like this:

.. figure:: ../_static/images/CAD/newbasicscene.png

      the basic scene block.

Go ahead and add a new basic scene to our workspace, right now it is an empty scene that we need to start adding objects to it in order to build our world.


.. note:: the new basic physic scene is similar to the basic scene but contains gravity, only use it when needed for game or animation logic.


.. _sceneadd:

Next  we have the add block, this allows us to add an object to our scene objects include shapes, geometries, lights and more go ahead and take the scene.add block and plug it under the basic scene block.


.. figure:: ../_static/images/CAD/sceneadd.png

      adding objects to our scene.

By default the add block comes preloaded with a cube, go ahead and press the DRAW button! here have succesfully added our first object to our scene.

Now that we know how to add objects to our world lets look at some of them:

.. note:: the add scene block in photorealistic mode, needs lights to work.

.. _objectLoader:

Object loader
=============================
Use an Object loader to load an obj or stl resource to the workspace, to add an object loader block go to CAD, then Parts, find the object loader block and click it.



.. figure:: ../_static/images/CAD/objectloader.png

Once you have an object loader in your workspace, click on the gear icon to open a file selection window, if you want to load a file from your PC click the "load" button" and browse your PC for an OBJ or STL file.
Also you can enter or paste an URL in the text box and then click the "load url" button to load from a web location.


.. figure:: ../_static/images/CAD/loadassets.png

you will see a preview of the file, then you can enter or click the "close" button, to close the window and go back to your workpsace.


Now you can add the loaded object to the scene as shown in the image
