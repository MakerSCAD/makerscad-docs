.. _basicscene:

The basic scene
=============================

In order to start creating a 3D world we first need to set up a scene, in ScratchyCAD we have preloaded a basic scene that comes with some basic lightning, material and shadow presets.
The basic scene can be found in the block library under the CAD/Tools section.

It looks like this:

.. figure:: ../_static/images/CAD/newbasicscene.png

      the basic scene block.

Go ahead and add a new basic scene to our workspace, right now it is an empty scene that we need to start adding objects to it in order to build our world.


.. note:: the new basic physi scene its similar to the basic scene but contains gravity, only use it when needed for game or animation logic.


.. _sceneadd:

Next  we have the scene.add block, this allows us to add an object to our scene objects include shapes, geometries, lights and more go ahead and take the scene.add block and plug it under the basic scene block.


.. figure:: ../_static/images/CAD/sceneadd.png

      adding objects to our scene.

By default the add.scene block comes preloaded with a cube, go ahead and press the DRAW button! he have succesfully added our first object to our scene.

Now that we know how to add objects to our world lets look at some of them:

.. note:: the add scene block in photorealistic mode, needs lights to work.
