New group
=============================

In MakerSCAD , you can group objects by declaring group variables, to do this, you can use the "Create Group" block

.. figure:: ../_static/images/CAD/newgroup.png

First go to "Variables" and select the "var" block, then go to the "Tools" section and select a "Create Group" block, snap the new group to the variable

.. _objectAdd:

Object add
=============================
When you declare a variable as a group, you can use a special block called "Create group".

.. figure:: ../_static/images/CAD/creategroup.png

in the previous section, we created a variable as a group, now go to tools and select the block that says "group.add"
Change the word "group" for the name you used in your variable and snap a new part to it, for this example we will use a torus.

Now add another "create group" block, use the same variable name you declared before, snap a sphere to it.

finally add the variable to the scene with a "scene.add" block, remember that you have to snap a "var" block to it

.. figure:: ../_static/images/CAD/groupadd.png

New Group
=============================
MakerSCAD also has a special block called "new group" that can be used to abreviate the steps in the past sections,find this block in CAD - Groups.
Note that it has a plus and a minus buttons, you can use them to add or remove objects, so, you can snap as many objects as you need.
