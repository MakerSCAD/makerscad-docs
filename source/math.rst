Makerscad has useful mathematical functions, you can find them in the Math section of the menu

Number
==============
In MakerSCAD there is a "Number"block, by default it has a zero but there you can enter de value that you need.

Basic operations block
=======================

This block allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations between two numbers like addition (+), sustraction (-), multiplication (*), division and power, to use it simply write a number on each side of the block and select the desired sign from the dropdown at the center with the little triangle.

you can use a variable and a 3D text (CAD - Parts - 3Dtext) like in the picture to see the result

Advanced operations block
===========================

 it includes operations like square root, absolute, negative, natural logarithm, log10, e power, 10 power


Trigonometric functions
========================

sin cos tan asin acos atan


Constants
===========

 pi, e, phi, sqrt(2) (sqrt1/2) infinity

even odd prime whole positive negative divisible by

change item: this block generates a programming expression that validates if a variable is a number and then adds the number indicated in the right of the block. if the variable is not a number, the block considers it as a zero

Round
=======
This block allows to round a number or expression

Aggregation functions
======================

 block sum, min, max, average, modes, standar deviation, random item

Reminder

Constraint

Random

Random fraction
