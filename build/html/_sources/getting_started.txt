First, we have the main toolbar

   the main toolbar

Here you can:

* SAVE your current work, it overwrites the latest save state.
* LOAD the latest saved version
* EXPORT your work into an xml file, for now the is test.xml increasing the file number, for example test1.xml,test2.xml... finding the next available number. 
* EXPORT the current 3d objects as a STL file.
* EXPORT the current 3d objects as an OBJ file.
* LOAD an asset (experimental).
* Confifure ScratchyCAD on the SETTINGS window.
* Go to the Documentation to get HELP learning scratchycad
* Check the ABOUT window for authors, copyright licence and more. 

Under the main toolbar at the left side is Work view

Here we have the block library left on the right most side.

* :ref:`cad`, Special blocks related to shapes, objects and parts.
* Logic
* Loops
* Math
* Text
* Lists
* Color

and the block workspace where we will be creating our world right next to it.

Some useful controls for our block workspace:

      Right click + Drag

      Mouse wheel up or down


On the Left side at the the top theres our 3D view, where we can se a preview of our world.
