The CAD blocks
***************

.. _main:

Using the main block
=============================

The most important block in ScratchyCAD is the main block, this block is a function that returns what to draw on our canvas.
this can be found under the CAD/Tools library.

It looks like this:

.. figure:: /_static/mainblock.png

      the main block.


This means that everything you plug in this block is going to get drawn in the 3D space
You can plug in any block from the Parts library test for yourself:

.. figure:: /_static/ex1.png

      using the main block

.. _cube:

Using the cube block
=============================

The Cube, cubes in ScratchyCAD can have different lenghts on each of their sides.
The cube is found under the CAD/parts library
Go on and grab the cube block and plug it to the main block.
this is the ScratchyCAD default cube that measures 1x1x1 units.

.. figure:: /_static/defaultcube.png

      ScratchyCAD's default cube



The first parameter in the cube is asking for a size XYZ, for every parameter in ScratchyCAD
that asks for XYZ we need to plug in a special block that contains a list of three numbers
one for lenght (x), width (y) and height (z).
for now grab a xyz block from the lists library and plug it to the cube block.

.. figure:: /_static/defaultcubelist.png

      xyz block in the Lists ibrary

.. figure:: /_static/defaultcubelist1.png

      xyz plugged to the cube block

Now we have a list we only need to get some values. Under the math library look for the first block that
contains a value of 0, this is a number block and you guessed right, it returns the value that the user types on it.
Go ahead and grab three number blocks for each of the xyz inputs. Try different numbers out,
remember to click on DRAW every time.

.. figure:: /_static/cubenumber.png

      the number block.

.. figure:: /_static/cubenumber1.png

      testing values on the cube xyz input.

The rounded value has two options true or false if true it will add a bevel on the sides of our cube,
the resolution will define the segments on the bevel and the radius will define the size of it.

.. warning::

   - **The radius can not be equal or larger than half of any of our size xyz values**.

.. figure:: /_static/cuberounded.png

      testing values on the resolution and radius.

.. figure:: /_static/cubeblock.png

      The cube block.

.. _sphere:

Using the sphere block
=============================

The sphere block can be found under the CAD/Parts library.

.. figure:: /_static/sphereblock.png

      the default sphere block.

The sphere has three parameters:
      * Diameter, a numeric value and defines the size of the sphere
      * Resolution, a numeric value that defines the number of poligons that make the shape
      * Icosphere , defines if the shpere should be drawn as a polyhedron, all sides will be identical triangles.

.. figure:: /_static/sphere.png

      a false value returns a sphere.

.. figure:: /_static/icosphere.png

      a true value returns a polyhedron

.. figure:: /_static/sphereblock1.png

      the sphere block



.. _cylinder:

Using the cylinder block
=============================

The cylinder block can be found under the CAD/Parts library.

.. figure:: /_static/cylinder.png

      the default cylinder block.

This block has five parameters:

      * Diameter1, a numeric value that defines the size of the lower base.
      * Diameter2, a numeric value that defines the size of the upper base.
      * Height, a numeric value that defines how tall is the cylinder.
      * Rounded, defines if the cylinder should be drawn with rounded caps instead of flat faces.
      * Sides, a numeric value that defines how many sides our prism will have.

.. figure:: /_static/cylinder1.png

      a cylinder with equal diameters and five sides.

.. figure:: /_static/cylinder2.png

      a cylinder with larger diameter2 and eight sides.

.. figure:: /_static/cylinder3.png

      a cylinder with a larger diameter1 and eight sides.

.. figure:: /_static/pyramid.png

      a pyramid can be made with a size zero diameter2.

.. figure:: /_static/cylinder4.png

      activating the rounded parameter duplicates the value of the diameter1 in diameter2.

.. _polygon:

Using the polygon block
=============================

The polygon block defines a 2D shape, this shape is given by a list of  at least three points (x,y,z) or vertices.
This given list of vertex creates a face in the x,y plane.

Go ahead and get the polygon block from the CAD/Parts library and plug it to your main function, by default it returns a
triangle rectangle.

.. figure:: /_static/polygon.png

      the polygon block with default vertex list.

To make things easer we have included the OpenSCAD-polygon-editor that allows you to draw from scratch or trace a shape from
an image, click on the gear in the top left corner of the polygon editor.

.. figure:: /_static/polygoneditor.png

      the polygon editor interface.

From the selector menu (cursor icon) you can turn any point to a Bezier curve handle, or vertex.

.. figure:: /_static/polygonselector.png

      the polygon selector menu.

We can add new vertices by clicking on the + icon next to the selector menu.

.. figure:: /_static/addapoint.png

      add vertex.

We delete vertices by clicking on the - icon next to the + icon.

.. figure:: /_static/deleteapoint.png

      add vertex.

Finally we can add an image to trace, by setting the URL, uploading it and then scaling it..

.. figure:: /_static/traceimage.png

      trace image.

Once we are done setting up the points for our shape click close and they will be automatically added to the polygon block.


.. _text3D:


Using the text3D block
=============================

The 3Dtext block can be found under the CAD/Parts library.

It allows us to create a text based model, this block has the following main parameters:

  * text : a string value with the characters we are going to draw.
  * width: a numeric value that determines the thickness of the characters.
  * height:  a numeric value that determines the extrusion amount of the characters.
  * x: a numeric value, the starting point on X for the characters.
  * y: a numeric value, the starting point on y for the characters.

.. figure:: /_static/text3d.png

      the text3D block.


.. _part:

Using the part block
=============================

It's nice to be able to return different shapes, but most objects in real world are a mix
of different shapes. Thats the what the Part  block is for! this one is found under the
CAD/tools library

.. figure:: /_static/ex2.png

      using the part block

The part block has three options:

* Union, adds two parts together.

.. figure:: /_static/union.png

      union of a cube with a sphere

* Difference, subtracts the second part from the first part, it's order sensitive.

.. figure:: /_static/difference.png

      difference of a cube with a sphere

.. figure:: /_static/difference1.png

      difference of a sphere with a cube

* Intersection, returns only the overlap of both shapes.

.. figure:: /_static/intersection.png

      intersection of a cube with a sphere
